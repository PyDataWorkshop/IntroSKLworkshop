 scikit-learn is a Python module integrating classic machine learning algorithms in the tightly-knit scientific
Python world (numpy, scipy, matplotlib). It aims to provide simple and efficient solutions to learning
problems, accessible to everybody and reusable in various contexts: machine-learning as a versatile tool for
science and engineering.

*   
Scikit-learn provides a range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms via a consistent interface in Python. *   Scikit-learn is licensed under a permissive simplified BSD license and is distributed under many Linux distributions, encouraging academic and commercial use.

\newpage
*   The library is built upon the \textbf{SciPy} (Scientific Python) that must be installed before you can use scikit-learn. 
*   This stack that includes:

\begin{description}
*  [NumPy:] Base n-dimensional array package
*  [SciPy:] Fundamental library for scientific computing
*  [Matplotlib:] Comprehensive 2D/3D plotting
*  [IPython:] Enhanced interactive console
*  [Sympy:] Symbolic mathematics
*  [Pandas:] Data structures and analysis
\end{description}
{}


*   Extensions or modules for SciPy are conventionally named SciKits. As such, the module provides learning algorithms is named scikit-learn.

*   The vision for the library is a level of robustness and support required for use in production systems. This means a deep focus on concerns such as easy of use, code quality, collaboration, documentation and and performance.

*   Although the interface is Python, c-libraries are leverage for performance such as numpy for arrays and matrix operations, LAPACK, LibSVM and the careful use of cython.

 \textbf{Underlying Technologies}
\begin{description}
*  [Numpy:] the base data structure used for data and model parameters. Input data is presented as
numpy arrays, thus integrating seamlessly with other scientific Python libraries.\\ Numpyâ€™s viewbased
memory model limits copies, even when binding with compiled code (\textit{Van der Walt et al.,
2011}). It also provides basic arithmetic operations.
*  [Scipy:] efficient algorithms for linear algebra, sparse matrix representation, special functions and
basic statistical functions. Scipy has bindings for many Fortran-based standard numerical packages,
such as LAPACK.\\ This is important for ease of installation and portability, as providing libraries
around Fortran code can prove challenging on various platforms.
*  [Cython:] a language for combining C in Python. Cython makes it easy to reach the performance
of compiled languages with Python-like syntax and high-level operations.\\ It is also used to bind
compiled libraries, eliminating the boilerplate code of Python/C extensions.
